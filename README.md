# Audio Style Transfer
This is another AST repo, although I tried to come up with some clean/organized code. I hope you'll find what you came looking for here :) 

Also, do not hesitate to reach out, it would be a pleasure to discuss style transfer.

## Code 

The code is written using python 3.9. The repositories was initialized using poetry. I also added a requirements.txt for those who prefer using pip/conda.

You can easily import the package `proj_sdsc` and use the methods there.

## Dataset

The data was to heavy to be transposed here. I won't create alternative data to come up with the lack.

## Other
Report as well as LaTeX source are in the [/report](report/) folder.
