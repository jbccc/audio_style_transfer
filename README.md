# Audio Style Transfer

This project offer a new way to do Audio Style Transfer. Indeed, many other project would do their method without rigorously assessing their results, like in every other branch in deep learning.

Although our method did not work in the end (especially because of the dataset), we believe that it will inspire others to do better.

Last but not least, do not hesitate to reach out, it would be a pleasure to discuss style transfer.

## Code 

The code is written in python 3.9. The repositories was initialized using poetry.

You can easily import the package `proj_sdsc` and use the function that composes it. I know there is imperfection but I will try to refactor everything as soon as possible.

## Dataset

The data is currently on a server. Instructions to download it will follow.

## Other
Report as well as LaTeX source are in the [/report](report/) folder.
